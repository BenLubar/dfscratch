Surrender your weapon, and I'll show you mercy!
Surely you can do better than that, mortal!
Armok commands you to submit!
Your kind shall be eradicated!
Hither fool! and face your death!
Not even a miracle could save you from my attacks!
Your blood shall rejuvenate my master!
Your kind is weak! You have no chance of survival!
Remember the war in Heaven! Remember the resistance!
Those pitiful "gods" cannot help you!
Where are those "gods" of yours?
To Thee, Armok, I commend this blood!
You monkeys don't even deserve to exist!
Didn't those "gods" teach you anything?
Have at you, scum!
