Dwarf Fortress from scratch
===========================
_The entirely player-made universe._

DF from scratch (dfscratch) is a project to redesign and rebuild the world of [Dwarf Fortress][1] entirely from scratch. We start with a vanilla version of DF, delete all raws with their creatures and bodies and templates and materials, and build an entire new player-made universe by hand.

See the [forum thread][2] and the [GitHub project wiki][3] for more information.
