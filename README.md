Dwarf Fortress from scratch
===========================
_The entirely player-made universe._

DF from scratch (dfscratch) is a project to redesign and rebuild the world of [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) entirely from scratch. We start with a vanilla version of DF, delete all raws with their creatures and bodies and templates and materials, and build an entire new player-made universe by hand.

See the [forum thread](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=127552.0) and the [GitHub project wiki](https://github.com/vyznev/dfscratch/wiki) for more information.
